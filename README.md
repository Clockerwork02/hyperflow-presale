## Fair Distribution Model

### Community Governance Principles
Unlike traditional presales that favor large investors through tier systems and exclusive allocations, HyperFlow Protocol implements a fair distribution model that ensures equal access and opportunity for all participants.

- **No Tier Discrimination**: All participants receive the same token price regardless of investment amount
- **No Wallet Caps**: Equal opportunity for all participants without artificial restrictions
- **Transparent Process**: Clear terms and conditions with no hidden preferences
